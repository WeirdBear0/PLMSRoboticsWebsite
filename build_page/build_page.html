            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>We are the build team, a team comprised of several 3D modelers and designers who work together to ensure that our robots work correctly and look amazing.</p>

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>The build team starts at the whiteboard, brainstorming the pros and cons of all the different mechanisms they
            can add to the robot. The 3-D modelers of the team use Computer-Aided Design on a site called Onshape to make a
            realistic model of all of the potential features. Then they get to work, assembling, screwing, and putting together a
            competition-ready robot. Build team members learn critical components of engineering and design, which will be applicable
            all throughout their lives.</p>
