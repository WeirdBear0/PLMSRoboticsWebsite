bio
Welcome to the Pine Lake Robotics Club! Our club is comprised of four sub-teams: software, build, media, and business. 
Each of these teams has an independent yet unique role to play in the development in group projects.
Our mission is to foster a diverse and inclusive community where individuals can come together and collaborate on exciting projects. 
We strive to not only build a successful team, but also to create a supportive environment that will continue to inspire future members. 
At Pine Lake Robotics Club, we value teamwork, creativity, and innovation. Join us on our journey to push the boundaries of robotics and create a better tomorrow!
