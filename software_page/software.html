            <h2>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>Our software team is made up of students from 7th through 8th grade at our school. Our members are experienced with a
             variety of programming languages and concepts, and we learn more throughout each year.</p>
            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>We program our robot's functions using Java. This is done in OnBot Java, a platform provided by FIRSTInspires
             for FTC programming. Our dynamic code serves a variety of functions, from making our robot autonomously respond
            to changing conditions for the first period of a match to making easy-to-use and responsive controls for our driver
            for the second part. Software members learn a variety of skills, which are not limited to robotics. Java is widely
            used as a backend programming language in companies around the world, and software members work on other projects,
            such as this website, as a part of the team as well, learning web development and a new approach to solving problems.</p>
